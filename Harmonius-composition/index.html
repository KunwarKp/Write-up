				<span>1.  HEARTBREAK!!</span> <br><br>

An extremely familiar word which we get to hear nowadays.<br>

Let me tell you my friend, there is no such thing called heartbreak. Its just our dreams, our expectations, our believes which are broken. <br>

Okay, to put it in a bit more emotional context, I should say .. its that little world, which we create with our beloved, which breaks, which comes to an end, which is brutally broken by the one we dreamt of.<br>

But our heart, it is still the same, pumps blood and beats as usual, it remains unchanged. <br>
It is not that weak to be broken by an asshole. You're not that weak to give up. Our heart works for us, it beats for our soul.<br>

The thing which is quite arduous to understand is, Why? Why do we give any other person to control it? To control our heart, to control us?<br>

My dear friend, I know it takes time, I know it takes not only a month or two, it takes a whole lot of time.<br>

But you know what? We can come over it, its not the end. The only thing we need to do is try to rebuild our dreams, and this time not for others but for ourselves. <br>

We should be our own centre of attraction and then we can also rebuild those expectations, and this time not from others but from ourselves.<br>

Believe in yourself and then each and every broken part of yours will regenerate itself. You'll be complete again and this time you won't search for your better half coz you're perfect, you're best and you'll know, everything happens for good!!<br>

				2.  CHALLENGE ACCEPTEDüëçüèª  <br> <br>

I'm stuck!!.. I'm unable to move on.. <br>

People say I can get over you if I get committed with someone else. <br>

But how can l? I don't wanna see anyone's face except yours!! <br>
I just wish you could feel the same... But you're someone else's now. <br>

This was a trap I guess... everything was planned !!
Right? <br>

You made me fall for you just for this day..? <br>
Am I not a loving material..? <br>
Why didn't you fall in love with me when I did everything possible to make you fall?
Or why did you make me fall when your intentions were not to catch? <br>

Oh..! So now I get it... <br>
I m an unlovable person..not a type anyone can fall in love with...
You said I'm Annoying.. Childish.. Crazy. These were the reasons for our breakup...right? <br>

But now I've changed baby, I've stopped acting childish and crazy... and I promise I'll never annoy you again... never ever!! I've  <br>started behaving mature.
Just the way you wanted... <br>

Now, Can you please come back to me..back to your love?  <br>
You said once that you can't live without me...
Though you don't remember... Still I don't want you to live without me..I want you to live with me!! <br>

I'm not asking‚Äã for the world... I'm asking for you..coz you're my world. <br>
These lines were very creepy for me before I met you and then you came into my world with all those wonderful meanings.
You're gone and now my world has torn apart. <br>

But we are not meant to be together.. this is what you said.. <br>
I wish you could afford a better excuse... <br>

Fine, I will have to spend my entire life with your memories? <br>
Aah...baby our memories are enough...
You wanna test me?..I will take it as a challenge!! <br>

				<span>3.  I'VE LEARNED!!</span><br><br>
				You know what I've learned from my past experiences?<br>

I've learned to express myself, I know it is going to hurt anyway. So, why not express your feelings first and then get whatever is meant.<br>

I would rather tell everyone about my feelings and get hurt than just sitting, observing, dying inside..
Because I know that hurts more.<br>

I've experienced that mum part of mine, I know how it feels when we expect someone to understand us but he doesn't even care about your existence.<br>

Actually this was also a good experience I must say. I've learned so much from my past that even the worst experience doesn't feel like it was bad.<br>

I'm fine with everything, I love myself and that's the most important thing. Self love is something without which you can't love anyone else. I've learned to love myself.<br> 

So in a nutshell I would say even the worst experience can be good sometimes. You just need to ignore its negative side and take everything positively.<br></p>

				<span>4.  NO MORE REJECTIONS!! </span><br><br>


"You're in love!!"<br>

Nah.. Are you mad? I'm not in love with him.<br>
Ya I do miss him sometimes when I feel lonely or at times when I'm with my friends or in a room full of people. Yes I do miss him when we're not together but this is because we're very good friends. You're overthinking.<br>

"This is love sweetheart."<br>

Are you crazy? This isn't love ..umm.. its just that ... I want to have a conversation with him and ..aa.. tell him about my day nothing else. Understand?<br>

"You're head over heels in love with him, even a fool will see it in your eyes.. why don't you just accept it?"<br>

(After a little pause..)<br>
Because I see his rejection in my acceptance.. I'm happy like this. I can't endure another heartbreak. I'm tired, I'm scared. Even his acceptance would be my loss. I don't wanna drag him into this, into my depressed world. <br>

"What if he says yes?"<br>

I can survive my entire life in the hope of "what if"!!<br>

				<span>5.  THE CRIME BEGINS.. </span><br><br>


And here the crime begins... MENTALITY!!<br>
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† " She was characterless...these all things were obvious to happen" ...these are the words of the society!!<br>
The society whom she thought are her guardians..whom she thought would help her in need....this 'society' is bothered about only the girls character.. instead of those bastards.. the so called "men".<br>

We all are so much concerned about bringing changes but what about changing ourselves.. Changing our own MENTALITY!!<br>

The girl might be wrong in some cases...she might be wrong for trusting the wrong guy but these things are to be kept apart...nobody has the right to judge her...nobody has the right to rape her...nobody has the bloody right to kill her.<br>

If you think about bringing changes...lets start from ourself...lets start today!!<br>

				<span>6.  I'LL FIGHT BACK ‚ù§ </span><br><br>
				I feel hollow, I feel dead inside.<br>

I just conceive sometimes, can I ever come out of this abbhorent situation? I swear I'm unable to bear anything now, everytime something from past comes into my mind I feel like dying.<br>
All my wounds get refreshed.<br>

I just want to run away from the position I'm at.<br>
Can't I for once, only for once feel the ultimate happiness?<br>

I know the answer.. It's a Big NO.<br>

I know its really ardrous to gather my strength allover again but I also know that I won't give up. I know how to inspire myself. I'm broken but people can only see me smiling, I can't show them my tears, it is meant just for me and my lonely nights.<br>
I will get through this, I will survive this situation.<br>

Aah that's really easy, if not from inside but atleast I can be this way from outside. Easier it is.<br>
And I know one day I'll be as happy as I always pretend to be.<br>
That would be the day I won't be scared of my past anymore. I won't shed even a single drop while narrating my story to anyone that day. There won't be any regret on my face, I'll be smiling not just from outside but this time from my inner soul.<br>

That real smile, I'm craving for that. And I know, that day is in near future. Till then.. I'll survive, I'll fight my demons, I'll fight my past!!<br>

				<span>7.  THANKYOU LETTER ‚ù§</span><br><br>


Dear beloved ex beloved,<br>

Chill!! This letter isn't to abuse you, I know you must have already assumed it because of my sarcastic salutation. Its in my blood you know I can't help it.üòÇ<br>

Okay so let me begin, actually this letter is to thank you... Aah not again, this time I'm serious.<br> 

I just realised that I'm over you, I've finally moved on.. but Idk why I keep depressing myself, I kinda feel bad for myself sometimes, and I don't exactly know the reason. <br>
Sometimes its really difficult to understand me, even when I'm 'me'. You must have left me for this, right?<br>

See I told you I can't help it..okay sorry no more taunts!!<br>

We can't force anyone to love us, you never loved me. Thats fine, that was always fine for me. But the thing is you pretended to. And that was the exact moment you became an asshole to me, I told you I hate drama.<br>
So, I hate you. I know you know that, but I love writing this, I feel better. But as I told you this letter isn't to curse you. Thankyou letter it is.<br>

So let me begin by thanking you for your drama, aah sarcasm again!!<br>
No its not. I thankyou for your drama from the core of my heart, seriously I do..it is only because of your drama and fake promises that I've stopped trusting people, and its nice, its perfect.<br>
Actually you've prepared me for future. Now its completely impossible to cheat me. Because now I know even those teary eyes can lie. Because now I know not all 'I love yous' we get to hear are true. Because now I know we can't make anyone love us unconditionally when they crave for your body and not your soul.<br>

And the next thankyou is for hurting my self respect!!<br>
Thankyou for underestimating me. I completely forgot to respect myself. I was so blindly in love with you that even my self respect meant nothing to me. <br>

But now I know to respect myself. Now I know having a bit ego is also just fine. Now I know I'm perfectly perfect the way I'm. <br>
There was a day when each and every moment of my life was depended on you. My mood depended on yours. I really really wanna thankyou that you left, coz now my mood depends on me and only me. <br>
And now I know love is not about sacrifices. 
Love is about love!! The word 'love' is deep in itself though we need someone to understand it completely but it is what it is. 
It meant world to me when you were there and now I'm in search of its deeper meaning.<br>

I hope you paid attention when I said I've moved on. I said this not because I've got someone better than you or I'm in love with someone else. Actually now I'm not even concerned about my love life. This love thing is natural, it just happens. We can't sit and wait for the moment to fall in love. So I've stopped searching anything anywhere.<br>

I said I've moved on because I've finally found the old me and came to know my worth. I finally came to know why god introduced us. And finally I know what to search in a life partner, the next guy I choose is definitely going to be permanent one and I'm glad its not you.<br>

Your happiest ex girlfriend!!<br>

				<span>8.  LET'S BREAK THE STEREOTYPE!!</span><br><br>


All we have heard since childhood is that boys cheat. Right?<br>

Let me tell you something, its not the gender who cheats its the person. Just because boys are unable to express doesn't mean they don't get hurt or they just can't love immensely like we claim that only girls do.<br>

I've seen a boy crying for a girl, the boy who laughed even when he failed his semesters and was kicked out of the house, he cried for a girl. What else do we call love?<br>

So lets just not differentiate between a girl and a boy. Lets say people cheat!!<br>

The unstable creatures who aren't bothered about anyone's feelings, who are selfish enough to hurt someone and feel nothing in return, they cheat. And you know what's the interesting part? We know that they are going to cheat us but even after knowing this we are unable to leave them. We take them as a challenge and try to change them when their fucking parents couldn't. <br>

I don't know what goes inside our brains, I now finally understand why we say love is blind.<br>
Its not only blind my dear friend, its dumb, deaf and what not?<br>

We all have been cheated.. not just by our beloved but from our friends, close ones etc etc. We have also been cheated by girls but we call them exceptions. Why not say all women are the same?<br>

Yes, I'm a girl but I just can't stand against boys and ignore everything a girl does and vice-versa. Though I'm against the society for claiming boys to be dominant, for being partial many a times but thats another reason, saying only boys cheat is just not acceptable.<br>

If we want equality why not treat ourselves equal first?<br>

So, all the girls and boys out there, lets not just be genders, lets be people.. lovely people!!‚ù§<br>

				<span>9.  WE'RE A MESS!!‚úå</span><br><br>

I'm a woman and I've seen other women getting offended when we are been called difficult, crazy or unstable. Even I get offended sometimes when I'm not in a mood to digest all these blames. But deep inside I know, we women know, that we literally are a mess!!<br>

We are just very confused.. like we enjoy when someone has a crush on us but we pretend like its so embarassing. We can talk about other people's crushes but we are unable to speak about the ones we are the crushes of. Women do you agree? I know we doüòÇ<br>

We just hate it when the guys gang stare us in the market or in the streets but we also are insecure when someone is staring another girl instead of us, we feel retarded.. don't we? I know we doüòÇ<br>

See, we know that we are a mes, a complete mess. We don't understand ourselves and we want other guys to understand us. Is it even possible? We know its not.üòÇ<br>

We laugh at our own lame jokes. We enjoy every bit of our life. So why to get offended when someone points out the truth?<br>

Lets just be proud that we are difficult... The next time anyone says you're a mess just give them a broad smile and say that we are proud of ourselves. We don't fake to be real. Yes we are a mess and we love being the way we are.<br>

Shout out to every wonderful messed up women out there. Just remember we are awesome.<br>

				<span>10.  THE ULTIMATE PROPOSAL ‚ù§</span><br><br>

I know I'm an idiot. Like seriously where were I? How can I not see your love!! My bad, but I won't say sorry. I would rather pay for it.<br>

You know me right? The girl with ego as high as the mountains!! But still I'm here, I don't know how all my ego vanishes when I see you. May be you're just very adorable to tolerate my tantrums. (I love to see you blush and that too when I'm the reason behind it)<br>

You've expressed your love (I was an asshole that I didn't accept it at the exact moment, may be I was too scared to express!!)<br>
But now I can't stand to bear this separation anymore.<br>

Let's just be honest together, genuine together, and love each other unconditionally.<br>
Let's unite and be another love birds, who flies high and crosses every ups and downs!!<br>

So, my dear beloved. Though I took a whole lot of time to realise that you're the one. But its better late than never. Isn't it?<br>

Today I finally gained my strength to confess my love for you. But before accepting or rejecting, just do remember you're signing yourself for a lifetime. Either a no for lifetime or a yes for an eternity. (I know it's a yes though)<br>

So here I'm, bent on my knees with an imaginary rose in my hand, looking straight into your eyes....<br>

Will you please just reciprocate everything for once, and allow me to love you passionately, the way you do?<br>
			</p>

		<br><br><br><br>
		<div id="11">
			<p>
				<span>11.  I've changed. </span><br><br>


People say changes ain't good. But I love the person I've become. This is what love does, it makes us a better person, and a love failed makes us the best. Not just for others but for ourselves too.<br>

I've gained so much in a few years that even a slightest thought of getting back to the person I was, scares the hell out of me. I don't know what exactly happened or what was the exact reason of my transformation but I do know that the worst experience brings the best out of you, and so it has done to me.<br>

I adore the person I've become. Far more sensible than I were, far more lovable than I were, and most importantly far more stronger than I ever were.<br>

I won't take anyone's criticism anymore. I know my worth and I don't need anyone to show it to me. I don't need a better half because I'm the best all by myself.<br>

Call it over confidence or arrogance, I won't change now. It took me too long to become the person I'm today, to raise myself, to bring together my broken pieces. Now when I finally helped myself to enter a new world, I won't let anyone's word effect me even a bit. Think whatever you want, whatever you like.<br>

I love myself and I'm strong enough to admit... Yes, I've changed.<br>

				<span>12.  Nothing lasts forever!</span><br><br>


After your departure I cried, I screamed,<br>
But you were long gone.<br>
Even god refused to listen to me that day.<br>
May be the scream, the cry was inaudible.<br>
I want answer, I want fucking answer man!!<br>
Why did you punish me? What was my fault?<br>
That I loved you unconditionally?¬† <br>
Do you even know what I'm going through?<br><br>

You don't know anything,<br>
You don't know what I'm going through,<br>
You don't know how it feels when you still love<br>
But that person feels nothing in return!!<br><br>

But you know what? Not now, Not today,<br>
not tomorrow. But someday...<br>
Someday I'll definitely move on<br>
I won't cry over my past again.<br>
I just wish you to feel the same ache like I do.<br>
I don't want you to come back to me<br>
I just want you to be guilty about your deeds.<br><br>

That day I would be the happiest girl ever.<br>
I motivate myself by conceiving..<br>
Nothing lasts forever nor does bad days.<br>

				<span>13.  I CAN HEAR YOU‚ù§ </span><br><br>


I was so sure that I'm done. I knew I can never love again. Love is to be experienced only once and I've missed my chance. So what if it didn't last longer, I can never love again. Even my mind gave up, the more I wanted to forget my past the closer it came.<br>

I won't say that I was upset, because I was happy, but blank inside. I couldn't feel the 'so called' love, may be I didn't want to. I was happy being sad, I actually enjoyed my sadness. All my hopes were murdered, I had closed the door that lead to my heart.<br>

It is not that nobody ever knocked or nobody ever made an effort to open it, but it was me who never heard the knockings or should I say I never wanted to hear it.<br>

And then a miracle happened, it was you on the door... I don't know how but not only the knocks but I could hear your heartbeats this time.<br>

This time I wanted a chance not for you but for myself. I wanted you to make an effort so that I could finally gather my strength to let you enter inside me, inside my world.<br>

On the other hand I was scared, I was scared to loose you, but I was also badly broken to make the first attempt.<br>

I was desperately waiting for you to come, and I knew you'd come. You were the one who regenerated my hope, how can you leave me without setting me free?<br>

You made me realise that love can happen twice. And trust me it is the bestest feeling.<br>

Because of you I started dreaming of future when past was my only hope. I was finally able to run away from this hope and step forward where a new world was waiting for me.<br>

And even when I knew that you're not going to undo my past, I was still obliged to you that you finally came and woke me up, that you made me see when I didn't want to. That you helped me when I couldn't help myself out.<br>

				<span>14.  Dear boy friend,</span><br><br>


I know the space between boy and friend must be bothering you.<br>
But it's high time now.<br>

Ain't you done pretending everything? Because I'm. I'm tired. I'm not going with this bullshit anymore.<br>

Its been 6 years and we're still together. I think both of us deserve happiness. Don't we?<br>

We are together just for the other one's sake because there's nothing left in our relationship. We don't wanna hurt each other because we care. I don't know why we have labeled our bond with this love thing.<br>

I don't want things to turn horrible. Even if we meet after years I want to see love in our eyes rather than hatred. So that we could place order for each other without hesitating that we still remember the old days.<br>

I'd love to share a moment like that. But right now things are not working and I don't even want it to work this way. I feel like I'm pretending every minute. I can't stand to live this fake life anymore. And I know same is the case with you. You're dying to scat every moment. We just can't afford to hurt each other, isn't it? And we are erroneously claiming it to be love.<br>

It's NOT. It's attachment. Just like we are attached to animals and things and stuff!<br>
We need to find the love of our life don't you think so?<br>

I thought quite a number of times before writing this letter to you. It took me a lot of courage to vent out. It was mandatory.<br>

It's for our own benefits. We are doing injustice to ourselves by not letting each other free. Is it fair enough?<br>

Don't you think we too deserve to feel those butterflies in our stomach? To be excited about someone's text and calls? To crave for someone special's company? I truly think we do.<br>

Let's drift our ways.<br>
For our own good?<br>
Good luck. Good bye.<br>

Yours lesser love more of a friend!<br>

Suicide is never an option. Suicide should never be an option.<br>
Do you even have any idea what you've done? How much you've hurt your family and friends? Yes, friends. The one you're not even aware of. Who are fighting for you, fighting for you to get justice.<br>

I know it's your decision if you want to tolerate something or not. It's your choice if you want to feel anything or not. It's always your choice if you want to live or not.<br>

But I can't gulp down the fact that an understanding and innocent girl could be this selfish that she was not concerned about her mother!<br>

I can't even express in words what Olivia is going through. You knew about your dad's affair. Didn't you? Still you left your Mom alone. Was your pain more important than your mom's happiness?<br>

You were beautiful, young woman full of life and dreams and passion and fears and feelings like any other teenage girl. And I don't blame you. I know it's not your fault but you killed yourself girl. Why?<br>

I don't know a single woman who hasn't faced sexual assault, abuse or worse. Not one. Many survived.<br>
Jessica, Skye, Chloye and many more they all survived. You didn't. They are the real heroes because they chose to fight back and made their own selves proud unlike you.<br>

I wish you were alive. I wish you had chosen to fight back instead of giving up. You let us down Hannah!<br>

What a mess you have made with nothing but an idea that you were not enough. You always were!<br>

The girl who survived.<br>
